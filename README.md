Beginner-friendly explanations of React's core architecture: Virtual DOM, Reconciliation, and React Fiber. Includes detailed markdown documentation for learning and reference.

# ⚛️ React Core Concepts: Virtual DOM, Reconciliation, and Fiber

This document explains three fundamental concepts in React:

- ✅ Virtual DOM  
- 🔁 Reconciliation  
- 🧵 React Fiber  

Written in simple and clear language, this is perfect for beginners who want to understand what's happening behind the scenes in React.

## ✅ 1. Virtual DOM

### 💡 What is it?

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a **lightweight copy** of the real DOM. It’s stored in memory and helps React optimize UI updates.

> Instead of manipulating the real DOM directly (which is slow), React updates the Virtual DOM first.

### 🚀 How it works:

1. You write UI using JSX.
2. React creates a Virtual DOM tree.
3. When state/props change, a **new Virtual DOM** is generated.
4. React compares the old and new trees (using the diffing algorithm).
5. Only the **changed elements** are updated in the real DOM.

### 🔥 Benefits:
- Faster rendering
- Smooth UI performance
- Minimal real DOM manipulation

## 🔁 2. Reconciliation

### 💡 What is it?

**Reconciliation** is the process where React **compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one** and updates only the parts that changed in the real DOM.

> React uses an efficient **diffing algorithm** to avoid full re-renders.

### ⚙️ How reconciliation works:

- If elements have the **same type**, React updates their attributes.
- If elements have **different types**, React destroys the old node and builds a new one.
- Keys help React track which elements were added/removed in a list.

### 🧠 Example:
If you change:

<h1>Hello</h1>
to
<h1>Hi</h1> 

React won’t re-render the entire DOM, only the text content inside <h1>.

# 🧵 React Fiber

## 💡 What is React Fiber?

**React Fiber** is the **new reconciliation engine** introduced in React 16. It's a complete rewrite of the old stack-based architecture of React to make rendering more **flexible**, **efficient**, and **interruptible**.

Fiber enhances React's ability to:

- Prioritize updates
- Pause and resume rendering
- Split rendering work into smaller chunks
- Improve responsiveness and performance for complex apps

---

## 🚀 Why Was Fiber Introduced?

Before Fiber:
- React updates were **synchronous**.
- Large UI updates could **block the main thread**, leading to laggy user experiences.
- Once rendering started, it **couldn't be interrupted**.

With Fiber:
- Rendering becomes **asynchronous and interruptible**.
- Tasks can be **prioritized** (e.g., user input vs background data).
- React can yield control back to the browser during long renders.

## 🧱 What is a Fiber?

A **Fiber** is a **unit of work** that represents a node in the React component tree.

Each Fiber object contains:
- Information about the component (type, props, state)
- Links to its **parent**, **child**, and **sibling** Fibers
- Metadata needed for scheduling and rendering
